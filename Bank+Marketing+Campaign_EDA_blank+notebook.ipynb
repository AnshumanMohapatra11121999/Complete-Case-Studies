        "- **Scale values if required**: Make sure all the observations under one variable have a common scale.\n",
        "- **Standardise precision** for better presentation of data, e.g., change 4.5312341 kg to 4.53 kg.\n",
        "- **Remove extra characters** such as common prefixes/suffixes, leading/trailing/multiple spaces, etc. These are irrelevant to analysis.\n",
        "- **Standardise case**: String variables may take various casing styles, e.g., UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, Sentence case, etc.\n",
        "- **Standardise format**: It is important to standardise the format of other elements such as date, name, etce.g., change 23/10/16 to 2016/10/23, “Modi, Narendra” to “Narendra Modi\", etc."
